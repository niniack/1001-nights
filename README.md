# Visualizing the 1001 Nights

Check out: http://nights-vis.herokuapp.com/

The 1001 Nights have the unique quality of having multi-layered stories. Several
tales are "frame stories" which contain multiple tales within.

Each ring, or level, in the chart represents a layer with respect to the tale of 
King Shahryar and Shahrazad. The size of the slices in the chart is determined
by the duration, in terms of nights, of each story. Moreover, the graph is chronological, with the first story at 0&deg;, moving clockwise.

The idea was inspired by and the data was obtained from [this wonderful blog](https://1001recaps.org/2020/07/06/visualisation/).
The plot was generated using [Plotly and Dash in Python](https://plotly.com/python/sunburst-charts/). The "King of Thieves" font was produced by [Joanna Vu.](https://www.fontspace.com/king-of-thieves-font-f35030) 

Work done for the [1001 Nights course](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/arts-and-humanities/faculty/paulo-lemos-horta.html) taught by Professor Paulo Horta.
